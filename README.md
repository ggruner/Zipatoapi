# Zipatoapi

I'm developing a new Python Class for the Zipabox (Zipato) API. At the moment the Project is in an early Stage, but the Class will be growing. I'll upload a few examples and how you can use the Class to write your own automated scripts in the next days.

You are welcome to fork this Project and to extend the Python Class for your own needs.

This page will be updated in rationally.
